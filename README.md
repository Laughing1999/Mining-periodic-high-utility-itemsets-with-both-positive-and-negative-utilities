"Mining-periodic-high-utility-itemsets-with-both-positive-and-negative-utilities" is pubulished in EAAI.
The repository contains codes and released pdf of the paper.

Code: this paper proposed two algorithms, PHMN and PHMN+, which are contained in folder PHM-improve. And PHMN+ is controlled by a parameter 'improve' in .\PHM_improve\src\test\java\MainTestPHM_improve.java. When 'improve' is set to true, PHMN+ is activated; else, PHMN is activated.
As for FHM-folder, codes of improved FHM are shown. It is a modified version of FHM that can handle negative utilities and combine DU pruning proposed in this paper.
